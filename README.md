Online Voting System is an alternative voting channel to increase voter participation, reduce election costs while upholding the highest security, verifiability and integrity standards.

Online Voting enables voters to cast their vote privately and easily from any location and on any device with Internet access (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.), ensuring maximum election engagement by enabling remote and disabled voters to participate on equal terms.

Voter privacy, election integrity, end-to-end security, vote correctness and full verifiability (individual and universal) are guaranteed . This enables election officials to assure citizens that their votes remain cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast and counted-as-recorded. In addition to the added accessibility and security, operational efficiencies result from significantly reduced costs and the delivery of more timely and accurate results.
